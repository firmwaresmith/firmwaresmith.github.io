This is my second approach at running a blog about embedded programming.
Runing a blog involves writing posts and creating engaging content.
During my first approach, I struggled to produce content consistently.
After a year I decided not to renew domain and VPS server, ultimately shelving the idea entirely.

Over time, I realized what was holding me back - you wont be surprised when I say it was procrastination.
But what causes procrastination? In my case, one significant factor is perfectionism.

Initially, I tried launching the blog using WordPress and a Virtual Private Server.
However, it didn't feel good enough, and I constantly worried about potential issues, like
something breaking or needing to upgradfe to a newer version of WordPress.

This fear led me to explore other options, such as contributing to excellent [Memfault Interrupt](https://interrupt.memfault.com/)
blog. However, writing for such a high-quality platform was even more daunting - I didn't
want to risk submitting mediocre content and facing rejection during the PR review.

So, how can a perfectionist successfully start a blog?

The key is to use simple, low-maintenance technologies. For instance, a static site generator
like Hugo allows you to quickly write porsts in Markdown and manage your content in a GitHub repository.
Hosting the blog on GitHub pages reduces maintenance costs and removes the pressure to post regularly - your
site can sit idle for years without stress. Writing semi-anonymously under pseudonym frees you from
worrying about your ego and lets you write without the fear of imperfecton.

I hope you will enjoy my thoughts on embedded programming.
